        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h2>With this burger recipe it won't take too long to cook. You will need a grill though for the meat, but after that it won't take too long to put together.</h2>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
            <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
